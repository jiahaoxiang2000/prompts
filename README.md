# Prompts

We know that great prompts will yield even better results from the LLM. This project is a collection of prompts that we used on the GitHub Copilot for our diary jobs. Additionally, we want to easily sync the prompt files across multiple projects, so we use a git submodule to keep the prompts in sync across different projects.
